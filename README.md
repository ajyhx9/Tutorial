A **digital image** is a numeric representation of a two dimensional image. There are two main types Raster and Vector 

### Raster Image

A raster image is made with a **bitmap** and has set locations for each pixel. It looks blurry if you zoom in.

### Vector Image
 
A vector image is is constructed using a series of math equations. If you zoom in it still looks smooth. It's good for logos and fonts.

###  Color Depth

Color Depth is also a fator in digital images the amount of bits the picture uses controls how much color it has.
